# Secure File Transfer Application

## Overview

This application allows two users to securely transfer files between each other using RSA and AES encryption. The code operates in the terminal and provides graphical interfaces for both users, allowing each to act as either a server or a client.

## User Interfaces

### User A

- **Send a File**: Encrypts and sends a file to User B.
- **Receive a File**: Listens for incoming files and decrypts them.
- **Exit**: Closes the application.

### User B

- **Send a File**: Encrypts and sends a file to User A.
- **Receive a File**: Listens for incoming files and decrypts them.
- **Exit**: Closes the application.

**Note**: Ensure User A and User B are synchronized. If one is sending a file, the other must be set to receive.
